# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project is an implementation of a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The project is written in Julia programming language.

## File Structure

- `main.jl`: The main script that initializes and trains the neural network, tests its performance, and plays a guessing game with the user.
- `neural_network.jl`: Contains the neural network implementation, including functions for creating the network, performing feed-forward passes, training the network, and testing its performance.
- `mnist_data.jl`: Handles reading and processing the MNIST dataset, including functions for loading and displaying images, and creating training and test batches.
